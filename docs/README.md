## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3, Flexbox, CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) - React animation library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Bundler / Runtime
- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) - Testing library
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) - Linter
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) - Code formatter

### What I learned

I learned a lot, since it was my first React project. Maybe components are too big and code isn't the cleanest, but I'm really happy with the final result.

### Continued development

Maybe I'll come back some time to my older projects to refactor them.
